## INSTRUCTIONS
 
1. Method
2. First lets make the curry
3. Drain and rinse the chickpeas and lentils. Peel and finely chop the garlic and ginger. Finely chop the scallions/ spring onions. Pick the coriander leaves from the stalk, finely chop the stalks.
4. Heat a large pan on a high heat. Once it’s hot add 1 tbsp of oil and the chopped scallion, ginger and garlic cook for 2 minutes. Add the spices and cook for 1 minute stirring constantly to avoid them burning.
5. Add the tin of coconut milk, drained lentils and chickpeas, along with the salt and black pepper and stir well.
6. Bring to the boil, then reduce to simmer for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure the lentils do not stick. Taste and season if needed. Add the coriander just before serving.
7. Fill and boil the kettle, once boiled fill a medium saucepan and add a generous pinch of salt. Cut the base of the fennel bulb and cut into half lengthwise, then cut each half into 4 chunks, giving you approx 8 chunks of fennel. Add the chopped fennel and tenderstem broccoli to the boiling water and bring to a boil and cook for 4 mins. Drain and let them dry out slightly and add 2 tbsp of oil and a pinch of salt.
8. Heat up a griddle pan until it’s nice and hot, add the fennel and broccoli in a single layer and cook on both sides until it starts to get nice char lines. Remove and set aside.
9. Take the local leaves and add 2 tbsp of pesto and mix it through well.
10. To bring the dish together get 4 bowls and divide up the rice, a spoon of kim chi, a spoon of sauerkraut, some broccoli, some charred fennel, a good serving of the curry on to each bowl and sprinkle with some chili flakes and enjoy!
